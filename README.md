# What I need before running
I am running python 3.10, but I'm sure any somewhat recent Python 3.x version will work

# How to get started
run in flag-games dir `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

CD into `flag-games/flag_games` dir then run `python manage.py runserver` to run the game locally

# Example of game
